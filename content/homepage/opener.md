My name is Alex and I turn boring lawns into wildflower gardens which support native pollinators, and happy birds. Less mowing, less watering, and more life is what I am about. If you're interested in getting started with native plant gardening so you can help pollinators, cut down on your water bill, and make real change, I've got you covered.

Letâ€™s turn your space into a little patch of habitat.
