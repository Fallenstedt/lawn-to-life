My name is Alex and I turn boring lawns into wildflower gardens which support native pollinators, and happy birds. Less mowing, less watering, and more life is what I am about. Whether you're into helping pollinators, cutting down on maintenance, or just want a yard that actually does something, I've got you covered.

Letâ€™s turn your space into a little patch of habitat.
