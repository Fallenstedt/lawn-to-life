One broken downspout system encouraged me to start a rain garden. Soon after, I started a wildflower garden and created a [certified backyard habitat](https://backyardhabitats.org/). I had no idea how alive my yard could become. Native bees, birds, butterflies and even dragon flies started appearing.

What began as a fix for drainage turned into a full-on passion for restoring habitat. I've seen firsthand how even a small patch of native plants can support wildlife, reduce maintenance, and make a garden alive.

Now, I help others make the same transformation, from lawn to life. Whether you want to support pollinators, reduce your water bill, stop mowing so much, I'd love to help you reimagine your space.
