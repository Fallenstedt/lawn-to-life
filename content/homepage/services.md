### Lawn Removal & Habitat Prep

Out with the grass, in with the good stuff. I’ll remove your lawn and prep the area for a thriving native plant habitat. This includes:

- Turf removal (sheet mulching, or machine, depending on the space)
- Laying down mulch (from a nursery or free chip drop)
- Tips and guidance for choosing and planting native species

You’ll be left with a clean, mulched canvas ready for wildflowers, native plants, birds, and bees to move in.
